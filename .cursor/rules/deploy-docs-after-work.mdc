# Deploy Documentation After Work

After completing a task or set of changes, always update and deploy the documentation website.

## Guidelines

1. **When to deploy**: After finishing any task that affects:
   - Theme files (`src/themes/*.scss`)
   - Theme service (`docs/src/app/services/theme.service.ts`)
   - Documentation components or pages
   - Package.json (version, exports, keywords)
   - README or CHANGELOG

2. **Deployment steps**:
   ```bash
   # 1. Verify docs build works
   cd docs && pnpm run build

   # 2. Merge develop to main
   cd .. && git checkout main
   git merge develop --no-ff -m "chore: merge develop - [description of changes]"

   # 3. Push to trigger GitHub Pages deployment
   git push origin main

   # 4. Switch back to develop
   git checkout develop
   ```

3. **What triggers deployment**: Pushing to `main` branch automatically triggers the GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys the docs to GitHub Pages.
